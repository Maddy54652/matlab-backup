function Q = quadSimp(fun,a,b,n)
% Compute the value of an integral using Simpson's 1/3 rule with uniform 
% subintervals. Each subinterval uses three uniformly spaced node points.
%
% Input:
%    fun = function handle to integrand
%      a = lower limit of integration
%      b = upper limit of integration
%      n = number of uniform subintervals
%
% Output:
%      Q = value of integral

% Evaluate the x-points and the function.


% Evaluate the integral.
Q =
